# Projects
# i have tried 3d printing even before I had learned any cad modelling software, suffice to say the models were rudimentary, but nevertheless they sparked my interest in making my own models, in particular I have always wanted to have a collection of the most influential rockets from each major space program to have ever existed
# Printing Delta IV Heavy was my first ever attempt at printing and, later assembling the parts, which did not result in a failed print. It has taught me a lot, namely the fundamental operational knowledge of using a 3D printer, such as changing the filament, unclogging the extruder, and calibration.
# Subsequent projects, namely the holders for polaroid photos were an attempt at constructing something that I could find a practical use for.
# My last project, was to design the mighty Saturn V rocket, which although does not possess many details, I tried my best to recreate the real thing.
