# Projects
# I have tried 3d printing even before I had learned any CAD modeling software, suffice to say the models I have printed were rudimentary, but they propelled my interest in creating my own, in particular, my goal as of right now is to design a collection of the most influential rockets from each major space program to have ever existed.
# Printing Delta IV Heavy was my first ever attempt at printing and, later assembling the parts, which did not result in a failed print. It has taught me a lot, namely the fundamental operational knowledge of using a 3D printer, such as changing the filament, unclogging the extruder, and calibration.
# Subsequent projects, namely the holders for polaroid photos were an attempt at constructing something that I could find a practical use for.
# My last project, was to design the mighty Saturn V rocket, which although does not possess many details, I've tried my best to learn different functions available in NX to recreate the real thing.
